# Image-Resizer-Tool
Image Resizer Tool This Python script automates the process of resizing and converting multiple images in a folder, making bulk image processing quick and efficient. Using the Pillow library, it reads all image files from a specified directory, resizes them to the desired dimensions, and saves them in a target folder.
